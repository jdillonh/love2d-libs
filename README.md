# love2d-libs
Libraries I have written for the Love2d game engine.  

Intended for use with version 11.x  

So far there are 3 libraries!

### animation.lua
Turns simple sprite sheets into easy to use animations.

### states.lua
Makes easy state machines with _load_, _update_, and _draw_ functions.

### timers.lua
Make easy timers to script your time based events.
