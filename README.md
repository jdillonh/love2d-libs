# love2d-libs
Libraries I have written for the Love2d game engine.  

Intended for use with version 11.x  

So far there are 3 libraries!

### [window.lua](window/)
Makes pixel art games with resizable windows easier.

### animation.lua
Turns simple sprite sheets into easy to use animations.

### timers.lua
Make easy timers to script your time based events.
